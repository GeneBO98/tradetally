# Tier Enforcement Implementation

## Summary

Billing is now enabled and tier restrictions are enforced throughout the application.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Backend - Billing Enabled**
- ✅ Database: `billing_enabled = true` in `instance_config`
- ✅ Environment: `BILLING_ENABLED=true` in `.env`

### 2. **Backend - API Protection**
Already in place:
- `/api/behavioral-analytics/*` → `requiresTier('pro')`
- `/api/health/*` → `requiresTier('pro')`
- `/api/watchlist/*` → `requiresTier('pro')`
- `/api/price-alerts/*` → `requiresTier('pro')`

### 3. **Frontend - Route Protection** (NEW)
Added `requiresTier: 'pro'` metadata to:
- `/analytics/behavioral` → Behavioral Analytics
- `/analytics/health` → Health Analytics
- `/markets` → Watchlists & Price Alerts
- `/watchlists/:id` → Watchlist Detail

### 4. **Frontend - Navigation Guard** (NEW)
Added tier checking logic in `router.beforeEach`:
```javascript
if (to.meta.requiresTier) {
  const requiredTier = to.meta.requiresTier
  const userTier = authStore.user?.tier || 'free'

  if (requiredTier === 'pro' && userTier !== 'pro') {
    // Redirect to pricing page
    next({
      name: 'pricing',
      query: {
        upgrade: 'required',
        feature: to.name,
        from: to.fullPath
      }
    })
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### Free Tier Users:
1. **Can see** Pro features in navigation with "Pro" badges
2. **Can click** on Pro features
3. **Will be redirected** to pricing page when they try to access
4. **Pricing page** will show which feature they tried to access

### Pro Tier Users:
- ✅ Full access to all features

### Admin Users:
- ✅ Always have Pro tier access (automatic)

---

## Testing

### Test as Free User:
1. Create a free tier account
2. Try to navigate to `/analytics/behavioral`
3. **Expected:** Redirected to `/pricing?upgrade=required&feature=behavioral-analytics&from=/analytics/behavioral`
4. Try to navigate to `/analytics/health`
5. **Expected:** Redirected to pricing page
6. Try to navigate to `/markets`
7. **Expected:** Redirected to pricing page

### Test as Admin (brennon.overton@icloud.com):
1. Login with your admin account
2. Navigate to `/analytics/health`
3. **Expected:** Page loads successfully (admins always have Pro)

### Test API Directly:
```bash
# Free user token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer FREE_USER_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/behavioral-analytics/overview

# Expected: 403 Forbidden with upgrade message
```

---

## Conversion Flow

When a free user clicks a Pro feature:

1. **Navigation** shows Pro badge → User knows it's premium
2. **Click** → Router guard catches it
3. **Redirect** → Pricing page with context
4. **Pricing page** can show: "Upgrade to access [Feature Name]"
5. **User converts** → Stripe payment
6. **Tier updated** → User gets Pro access

---

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/.env` - Set `BILLING_ENABLED=true`
2. `/frontend/src/router/index.js` - Added tier metadata and navigation guard
3. Database - Updated `instance_config.billing_enabled`

---

## Important Notes

### Navigation Visibility
Pro features **are visible** to free users with "Pro" badges. This is intentional:
- ✅ **Good for discovery** - Users know Pro features exist
- ✅ **Good for conversion** - Teases premium features
- ✅ **Good UX** - Clear upgrade path

### Backend is Primary Defense
- Frontend guards are for UX only
- Backend always checks tier via middleware
- Users cannot bypass tier checks via API

### Admin Override
- Admin users (`role = 'admin'`) always get Pro tier
- Tier service returns 'pro' for admins regardless of subscription

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Billing enabled in database
- [x] Billing enabled in .env
- [x] Backend routes protected with `requiresTier('pro')`
- [x] Frontend routes have `requiresTier: 'pro'` metadata
- [x] Navigation guard checks tier and redirects
- [x] Navigation shows Pro badges
- [x] Admin users have Pro access
- [x] Batch import limits enforced (100 per import for free)

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Enhance Pricing Page** to show which feature user tried to access
2. **Add Usage Limits UI** to show remaining imports (100 per batch)
3. **Add Upgrade CTAs** in the UI when approaching limits
4. **Track Conversion** metrics (clicks to pricing page)
