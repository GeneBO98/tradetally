🚀 Frontend Debug Steps for Empty News Filter Results:

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Filter trades by "With News"
4. Look for these debug logs in the console:

Expected logs when filtering for "With News" (should return 0 trades):

📦 Set trades from tradesResponse.data.trades: 0
📊 Trades data structure check: {
  hasTradesProperty: true,
  tradesLength: 0,
  isArray: true,
  firstTrade: "none"
}
Analytics data received: {
  summary: { totalTrades: 0, ... },
  totalPnL: 0,
  winRate: 0,
  totalTrades: 0
}
🔍 Final trades array state: {
  tradesLength: 0,
  isArray: true,
  isEmpty: true,
  shouldShowEmpty: true,
  firstTradeSymbol: "none"
}

If you see tradesLength: 0 but the table still shows trades, then there's a Vue reactivity issue.

The problem might be:
1. Vue not detecting the array change
2. Component not re-rendering when tradesStore.trades changes
3. A cached reference to the old trades array somewhere

Check if tradesStore.trades.length === 0 in the Vue dev tools when the issue occurs.
